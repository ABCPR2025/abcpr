This is a draft of Malembe and Adriana's CDSsi 2025 Digital Publishing project. We thought about doing an integration of our work with Plena lyrics and Children's Poetry. We aim to cluster these resources as a way to offer alternative educational materials on Puerto Rican history and culture. We integrated text and visual resources to amplify the access of this knowledge in an interactive way.
